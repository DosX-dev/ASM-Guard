The program is written in VB NET and is still closed source. However, if the project is popular, then I will consider publishing the original source code.

## Use it for C++ application?
Use [obfusheader.h](https://github.com/ac3ss0r/obfusheader.h) by [ac3ss0r](https://github.com/ac3ss0r) for compile-time reliable obfuscation of your code before applying **ASM Guard**.
This is a complex protection using a CPP-header file that is almost impossible to remove using unpackers or other special tools.
